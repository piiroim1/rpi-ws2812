# Running
To reproduce the measurements, execute following at the repository root:
```
git checkout 77ba8b684186394a641c61bd92637b431a387835
gcc -o ws2812 main.c
for i in `seq 1 20`; do echo $(sudo ./ws2812) >> t_cycles.txt 2>&1; done;
```
# Notes
The print is messed up because, for one reason or other, newlines do not work in printf.

The host resolution errors disappear halfway through because I was fixing the /etc/hosts file while running the measurements. The errors we see are probably from running sudo while the hostname of this coputer was incorrectly set in /etc/hosts. It at least seems that the error would've caused a significant performance loss, even though it would#ve been thrown before executing the program. The cycle times seem to be quite sensitive to all kinds of interference. If we want to update gpio with sub microsecond precicion, we would probably need to dynamically update the cycle times. I don#t think there is any other way to get sub microsecond precision than counting cycles.
